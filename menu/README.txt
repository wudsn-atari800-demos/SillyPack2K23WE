Welcome to SillyPack 2k23 WE!

This provides you with all Atari
XL/XE entries in a sweet package.

As for the regular entries, I have
invested a lot of time to find the
real (real) final versions and make
them run, provide complete info
texts and so on.

If you find something that does not
work, just write to jac@wudsn.com.
