This is a new datadisc for my game
Zdendazuma II., which was published
in Abbuc-magazine last year. 

The datadisk contains 40 original
rooms, every datadisk therefore is
an independent game. The datadisk
was completely made by my son Tobik
in my room editor.

I programmed all of this because I
think that the original Montezuma is
the most beautiful game anyone has
ever made - and with my game I wanted
to express my admiration and respect
for the author of how much I love the
original.

Attention: This game saves score and
loads rooms from disk, so if you play
it in an emulator, set this ATR to
R/W in the drive!

I would also like to point out that
there are about 110 rooms in the
original Montezuma - but many rooms
are used even 8 times. I only have 40
rooms in each data disk, but EVERY
ONE IS DIFFERENT. So I have more
rooms than the original!

Note: The datadisk needs to be run
from disk drive "D1:"!


The datadisk comes separately and
is included in the download as
"SV2K23WE_ZDENDAZUMA_DATADISK07.atr".
