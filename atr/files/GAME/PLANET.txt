Info:    Mono
         Requires 1MB RAM (Rambo)

The game consists of 2 XEX files,
each runing on a separate Atari.
1) The main "PLANET.xex" contains
   the main game, it can run
   independently. The auxiliary
   "PLANETAU.xex" is not needed.
   This XEX is for Ataris with
   "1MB Rambo". I've tested it on
   Atari 600XL with "AVG SUB cart"
   (with PBI-cable connected so that
   I have 64kB memory on 600XL plus
   1MB rambo).
2) The auxiliary "PLANETAU.xex" is
   not needed for playing, but if is
   present on a second connected
   Atari, the main program
   communicates with it.
   This XEX needs only basic 64kB
   memory, I tested it on Atari 800XL
   without any modifications.

 If you want to enjoy the game with
 two Ataris, the both must be
 connected via the joystick-ports:
 A cable must connect the joystick
 port 2 of the Atari running
 "PLANET.xex" to tje joystick port 1
 of the Atari running "PLANETAU.xex".

 In the game you can find rooms in
 DARKNESS (without lights). In that
 case you can use the flashlight
 (joystick button), however, the fuel 
 ill be consumed faster and you will
 see all the colors in the room in
 yellow shades.

Using the [M] key the full map of the
maze will be displayed. The game
contains 200 different rooms.

To open door you need to find the
"door opening card", or the rescue 
module crashes.
