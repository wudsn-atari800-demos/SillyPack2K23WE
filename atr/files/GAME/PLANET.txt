Hello !

Sorry for my bad English.

I am a programmer from the Czech Republic. I have programmed games such as:
 - Pacman labyrinth
 - Space invaders battle
 - Ufon
 - Ninja-help-icopter
 - Robbery
 - Fire fighter Tobik
 - ZdendaZuma I.
 - ZdendaZuma II. (with 7 datadisks)
 - Multijoy roulette for 17-players (16 players play with a joystick via multijoy and the last one on the keyboard as a croupier)
 - Bombeeno
 - Atari hotline
 - Dark City Road
 - Greedy bat
 - Robot and Minion
 - Tetris T
 - ...

I confirm that I wrote all these games myself, every one byte.

PlanetRescueMission

!!! IMPORTANT:
 The game consists of 2 XEX files, each run on a separate Atari.
 1) The main "PlanetRescueMission_mainGame.xex" contains the main game, it can run independently, the auxiliary "PlanetRescueMission_auxiliary.xex" is not needed.
    This XEX is for atari with "1MB rambo" - I tested it on Atari 600XL with "AVG SUB cart" (with pbi-cable connected so that I have 64kB memory on 600XL + 1MB rambo).
 2) The auxiliary "PlanetRescueMission_auxiliary.xex" is not needed for playing, but if is present on second Atari, the main program communicates with it.
    This XEX needs only basic 64kB memory, I tested it on Atari 800XL without any modifications.

!!! IMPORTANT:
 If you want to enjoy the game with second Atari, both Atari must be connected via joystick-ports:
 cable must be from Atari with "PlanetRescueMission_mainGame.xex" JOY 2 to Atari with "PlanetRescueMission_auxiliary.xex" JOY 1.

!!! IMPORTANT:
 The main "PlanetRescueMission_mainGame.xex" contains the main game, it can run independently, the auxiliary "PlanetRescueMission_auxiliary.xex" is not needed.

!!! IMPORTANT:
 In the game u can find rooms in DARKNESS (without lights) - in that case u can use the flashlight (JOY-BUTTON), however, the fuel will be consumed faster and u will see all the colors in the room in yellow shades.

Using the [M] key the FULL MAP of the maze will be displayed.

Game contains 200 different rooms.

To open door u need to find the DOOR-OPENING-CARD, or rescue module crashes.

The author of the music in this game is Poison.
