Hello !

Sorry for my bad English.

I am a programmer from the Czech Republic. I have programmed games such as:
 - Pacman labyrinth
 - Space invaders battle
 - Ufon
 - Ninja-help-icopter
 - Robbery
 - Fire fighter Tobik
 - ZdendaZuma I.
 - ZdendaZuma II. (with 7 datadisks)
 - Multijoy roulette for 17-players (16 players play with a joystick via multijoy and the last one on the keyboard as a croupier)
 - Bombeeno
 - Atari hotline
 - Dark City Road
 - Greedy bat
 - Robot and Minion
 - Tetris T
 - ...

I confirm that I wrote all these games myself, every one byte.
I'm writing this mainly because of the ZdendaZuma-Datadisks, so that no one asks if I used Montezuma's original code.
No, I didn't use the original code, because I can't read other people's code.
If someone comes to the Czech Republic to Cesky Budejovice, they can view my complete source codes :)

I tested teh game on the original Atari 800XL (Drive 1050) without any modifications - all worked fine.
Also from old AVG Cart all worked fine.
When I tested the game on the original Atari 600XL with new SUB AVG Cart, sometimes option SETTINGS / POKEY EMULATION needed to be OFF.

Game requires disconnected BASIC - so press OPTION when you start tham.

This datadisk contains 40 new original rooms, and again - this datadisk IS AN INDEPENDENT GAME.
I programmed all of this because I think that the original Montezuma is the most beautiful game anyone has ever made - and with this my game I wanted to express my admiration and respect for the author of how much I loved the original.
Attention - this game saves score and loads rooms from disk, so if you play it in an emulator, set this ATR to R/W in drive !
I would also like to point out that there are about 110 rooms in the original Montezuma - but many rooms are used even 8 times - while I only have 40 rooms in each data disk, but EVERY ONE IS DIFFERENT - so I have more rooms than the original !


IMPORTANT INFO - this datadisk was completely made by my son Tobik in my room editor.
